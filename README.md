# isoform-specific-distribution-of-missense-mutations
Determining isoform specific distribution of missense mutations in around 300 developmentally and clinically relevant epigenetic machinery genes.
The purpose is to find specific isoforms and domains or exons within isoforms that have an unusually high number of pathogenic missense mutations.
